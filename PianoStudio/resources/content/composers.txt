Composer Biographies
	The Classical Tradition is not only fully of incredible music, it is full of the interesting stories behind the people that created it.
All art is an expression of the life and times it was made in, and each of the pieces these composers wrote carries with it
an emotional and artistic backstory that is just as inspiring as the music itself.
Understanding these musical pieces and their contexts can help us better understand both humanity and ourselves!
	To help us do this, I will continually write short biographies of composers and give some context on major works.
I'm not a historian though, so I'll leave the big stuff up to them and give links to further reading.
	Composer Biographies are organized by birthday, and the Artistic Eras the composers lived in.
