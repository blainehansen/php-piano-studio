What Makes My Methods Different
	To keep costs down for my students and their parents, I personally make or prepare all lesson books and exercises. 
The only thing I ask to be purchased is small, inexpensive repertoire books, since repertoire at beginning levels is very difficult to find or produce 
in respectable volume. After a certain level of ability however, all repertoire is free, since it has now become public domain and can be accessed at 
the website of this <a href='http://imslp.org/'>music cataloging project</a>. The only time it will be necessary to buy repertoire a
	Since many students are interested in playing music outside of the Classical Repertoire, 
<span class='important'>I will offer to write arrangements of a student's favorite songs at their skill level and help them through the process of learning them</span> 
in exchange for hard work and consistency with my expectations. Classical Repertoire will best prepare students for their favorite styles, 
and as they work diligently with me and my teaching plan they will find other music to be a breeze.
	Also, to be sure no important concepts or skills are missing from a student's understanding, I provide reference sheets of musical concepts, 
and give regular "quizzes" or "drills" to make sure things are going well. Don't worry though! These are no pressure and good performance is rewarded!
	/As a convenience, and to help students and their parents remember lessons, 
I use an internet system to send email or text reminders as a lesson approaches. This is completely optional, but I think you'll find it very handy!
