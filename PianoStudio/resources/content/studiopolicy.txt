Studio Policy
	A complete discussion of my studio can be found in this pdf document of my <a href='../PolicyandPhilosophy.pdf'>Studio Policy and Philosophy</a>,
which I urge you to read entirely. However, the essentials are outlined below.
	 Payments are handled on a monthly tuition basis. On the last lesson of each month, the next month is paid for in advance, regardless of the current balance.
In the case of missed lessons, makeup lessons are given, which can be done either as an extra lesson on another day, or as an extension of the normal lesson time on a day that would allow it. This is done to stabilize the studio's incoming payments, to help maintain a simple payment routine, and keep the amount of lesson time enjoyed by students consistent.</br>
In order to give other students a chance to use missed time slots for makeup lessons, notice of rescheduling is needed before noon the day of the lesson in order to receive a makeup. When I cancel an appointment I will give a makeup lesson, and if I am forced to do so with less than proper notice, I will give two makeup lessons.
	At higher levels, sheet music for almost the entire classical repertoire can be found for free at this 
<a href="http://imslp.org">cataloging project website</a> since it is now public domain.
However, at the beginning levels there is very little (interesting) music available. 
We will be using inexpensive repertoire books (between $4 and $7 every few months) for the beginning levels. 
I will purchase these as needed, and students or parents will reimburse me. 
If you want to play particular published pieces or to participate in official competitions you will need to purchase sheet music yourself.
