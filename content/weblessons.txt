Web Lessons
	I offer an exciting new type of piano lessons, given over the internet through 
<a href='http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/index.html'>Google Hangouts</a>.
These enable students to receive instruction from anywhere in the world, and could be Utah students who are traveling and want to stay in touch,
students who enjoy the convenience of a lesson while in their own space,
or students who don't live near me but desire my artistic insight or competitive prices.
	Google Hangouts provides a reliable and simple system to make this happen. With a webcam, an internet connection,
and a space with a piano, you and I can work together from anywhere in the world.
Set up an account if you don't have one already, and add <a href='https://plus.google.com/102804963436227201308/'>my studio profile</a>.
If you've never used Hangouts before, follow the instructions to <a href='https://www.google.com/tools/dlpage/hangoutplugin'>set the system up</a>.
Then, simply <a href='../Contact/'>contact me</a> to make an appointment.
	If you're worried about being able to use the system correctly, we can schedule a 15 minute session free of charge to work through the technical details
and make sure everything is working properly. This could be an extension of an already made appointment, or an appointment of its own.
	My Web Lessons are priced the same as my <a href='../Buy/'>normal lessons</a>, and can be paid for online.
