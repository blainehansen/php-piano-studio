Contact Information
	If you ever have questions, feel free to ask me! 
If your question is urgent, send me a text message at the number given on this page (since I'm very often unable to answer phone calls), 
and if your question will be better answered with a phone call I will call you as soon as I'm available to do so. 
Otherwise, send me an email, and I will carefully and thoughtfully answer.
