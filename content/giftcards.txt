Lesson Types and Pricing
	Depending on the seriousness of study, budget, and the age of the student, 
I offer three types of lessons (the names of which are based on music theory!).
	<span class='important'><b>Minor Lesson:</b> 30 minutes. $15.</span></br>Ideal for casual or busy students or for younger children.
	<span class='important'><b>Major Lesson:</b> 45 minutes. $22.50.</span></br>Most common and effective variety. A good length for optimal concentration and amount of material supplied.
	<span class='important'><b>Augmented Lesson:</b> 60 minutes. $30.</span></br>For serious students.
	Piano lessons can make excellent gifts! Does someone you know want music in their life and hasn't been able to make the leap? 
Buy them some lessons! The amount you spend can be used on any type of lessons and has no lower or upper limit, so it is flexible and can be used in any manner desired. Remember, when it comes to learning the piano, <a href='../Benefits/'>age doesn't matter!</a> Those you know who <span class='important'>played as children but have forgotten</span>, or those who <span class='important'>never learned but have always wanted to</span>, are always appreciative of a chance like this. Do something for them they'll always remember.
